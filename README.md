# Train-Scheduler

### Overview

A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.


### Instructions

1. Input train name, destination, the train's first departure time, and how frequently the train leaves.

2. The app will calculate when the next train will arrive; this is relative to the current time. (Users from many different machines can see the same train data real time!)
